This project is based on the id√© of showcasing my knowledge in frontend using the languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have also used Sass to structure my css into partials for easier navigation.

Step by step walkthrough:

1. Added the folder structure with pages, js, css, scss, src. 
2. Wrote the main index html code linking to my css file which is connected to my scss file.
3. Added a navbar and header.
4. Created and styled my topchoice main section which will become linked modals that open up and showcase a youtube video and a description.
5. Added a main library section and testing different audio solutions. Ended up using soundcloud for easy iframe styling.
6. Created a simple footer with email address.
7. Creating a modal in my topchoice section and linking each video to specific modal.
8. Created an array to be able to hide big paragraph content in main index file by linking to js array.
9. Added media quiries to each partial and edited the needed elements to fit the basic breaking points.
10. saved all linked images and gifs to local src folder and linked each image to local file. 

Steps to do in the future:
1. Add animation between pages.
2. Load time to big, search for better solution then soundcloud.
3. transition on page load for more immersive experience.
