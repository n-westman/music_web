            <p>I have since childhood had an interest for the art of creating. 
                Throughout my years in school I tried everything from writer to 
                comic book illustrator with finally finding music. When the time 
                came for me to share my music, I needed a website that could represent 
                me. In the process I found a whole new line of business in the art of 
                design and code.</p>
