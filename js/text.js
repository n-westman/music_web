    'My latest work has been a longer project where every detail has been important for the final result of the composition. Through several iterations I have taken a step closer to something I could feel sounded professionally. Which was also the purpose of the song. That it would result in something professional and emotional.'

    'When the song Hold Me Tight turned out to be a good step forward for my music, I naturally wanted to continue. But Hold Me Tight was not a song I felt myself could identify with. Therefore, I took all the knowledge with me when I instead started trying to find myself in the sound and less focus on what the listeners wanted. '

    'My music genre has never been carved in stone. I have been around several genres and tried to find my own identity sound. During this period I wanted something to happen, I wanted to get bigger promoters on Youtube to take note and see that I could actually do something good. From there came this powerful song with a strong start and emotional loop, I did my best to give the song what it deserved.'
